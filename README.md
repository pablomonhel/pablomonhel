## Hi there ðŸ‘‹. I am Pablo!

I am an economist and data scientist, and recent graduate of the Master of Science in Computational Analysis and Public policy of the University of Chicago. I am interested in economics, public policy, data science, and generative AI. 

My repositories:
1. https://github.com/pablomonhel/Silly-Gen-AI-Chatbot. I developed a chatbot with a very specific and silly personality using prompt engineering with Python and deploying it in a Streamlit app. The chatbot character has 6 distinct personalities which change depending on the questions of the user and displays images related to the personality on the app. 
2. https://github.com/pablomonhel/text-list-viz-Shiny-R. I created a Shiny app to display descriptive statistics from a list of text. It includes bar graphs, word clouds, co-ocurrence networks, and frequency tables. The original use is to analyze questions, demands and complaints from citizens to public officials. 
3. https://github.com/uchicago-mscapp-projects/the-cody-bills. I developed the frontend of the Cody Bills project, which analyzes the frequency in which a energy policy terms was discussed in the bills proposed in Texas and Pennsylvania. 
4. https://github.com/rmccormick96/Pulse-of-Policy. I trained machine learning models and displayed results, in tables and graphs, of the Pulse of Policy project, from a course of the University of Chicago. The project predicts whether outlet media articles influence the passage of of legislative bills in the House of Representatives.
